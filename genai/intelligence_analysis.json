  "executive_summary": "Detected 7 vessel candidates in the surveillance area, with 7 operating without AIS transponders. 0 vessels flagged as high risk. All 7 vessels have been analyzed for threat assessment and operational significance.",
  "threat_assessment": "MODERATE-HIGH. Primary concerns include 7 dark vessels indicating potential intent to avoid detection, commonly associated with illegal fishing or other illicit maritime activities. The presence of vessels in this operational area warrants continued monitoring and potential enforcement action.",
  "key_findings": [
    "7 total vessel detections analyzed",
    "7 dark vessels (no AIS) - 100.0% of total",
    "0 high-risk vessels (score >60)",
    "Average risk score: 40.0/100",
    "Geographic spread: Wide geographic distribution",
    "Detection confidence range: 6.9 - 17.8"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Deploy maritime patrol assets to investigate dark vessel activities",
    "Cross-reference detection locations with historical AIS and intelligence data",
    "Prioritize high-risk vessels for immediate follow-up surveillance",
    "Coordinate with regional maritime authorities for enforcement action",
    "Continue monitoring the area for pattern analysis and trend identification"
  ],
  "technical_notes": "Analysis generated using fallback mode due to API limitations. All 7 vessels included in assessment. Detection data processed from Ghost Hunter maritime surveillance system.",
