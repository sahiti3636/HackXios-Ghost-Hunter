The vessel size of 3724 pixels suggests a medium to large commercial vessel, likely in the 20-40 meter range typical of illegal fishing operations.\n\n**Behavioral Assessment:**\nThe vessel is operating without AIS identification (dark vessel status), which is a primary indicator of illegal activity in Marine Protected Areas. This behavior pattern is consistent with vessels attempting to avoid detection and regulatory oversight.\n\n**Geographic Context:**\nLocated at 6.2853\u00b0N, 93.4469\u00b0E within the Marine Protected Area boundaries. This position is in a high-value fishing zone during a restricted season, further supporting the assessment of illegal fishing activity.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- AIS transponder deliberately disabled or malfunctioning\n- Operating in restricted Marine Protected Area\n- Vessel characteristics match illegal fishing fleet profiles\n- Timing coincides with peak fishing season restrictions\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. Immediate interdiction by maritime patrol assets\n2. Evidence collection for legal proceedings\n3. Vessel identification and registration verification\n4. Crew interviews and cargo inspection\n5.
